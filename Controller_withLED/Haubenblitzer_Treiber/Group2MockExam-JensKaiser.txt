1. Please transcribe the word “Buttercup” in IPA:
	b u t œ r k u  p 
	
2. Give a bash command (can include pipes) that lists all files in the current directory, keeps the ones ending with .txt and prints the remaining ones alphabetically sorted.
	ls *.txt | sort | echo

3. Explain the process of LSA using SVD and how can we make use of the result of SVD to reduce the dimensionality of word representations?
	SVD can be used to reduce the dimensionality of co-occurence matrices. This happens mainly by eliminating dimensions which have a strong correlation. A function to compare the similarity of vectors, like cosine distance, can be used to infer the similarity between words.

4. Explain coarticulation? With an example.
	Coarticulation happens when two neighbouring phonemes influence the articulation of each other resulting in a slightly different place of articulation. 

l. What are the six levels of linguistics? Give a 1-2 sentence explanation of what each level examines.
	- Phonetics: Examines the sounds used to produce human speech
	- Phonology: Valid combination of phonems in human speech
	- Morphology: How words can be modified and changed
	- Syntax: How words can be combined to produce a valid string of words. This sentence may bear no meaning but its structure is correct.
	- Semantics: The meaning behind a sentence. The use of words to convey meaning.
	- Pragmatics: The same as Semantics but with the application of outside knowledge.
